django.nV
=========

django.nV is a purposefully vulnerable Django application provided by [nVisium](https://www.nvisium.com/).

### System Requirements & Setup 

First, make sure Python 3.4+ is installed on your machine. On OSX, this can be installed with Homebrew (eg. `brew install python3`). If you receive an error about conflicting PYTHONPATH, try updating the variable to reflect your python version.

```
export PYTHONPATH="/usr/local/lib/python3.4/site-packages"
```

Before using django.nV, you'll also need to install virtualenv. You should be able to use `pip install virtualenv`, using the pip package manager, to install it. On most systems, pip should be installed alongside python.

To set up the repository, use `virtualenv -p python3 venv`, which will create a virtualenv using Python 3. To enter this environment, run `source venv/bin/activate`. You should see your $PS1 update to include `(venv)` to remind you that you are in the virtual environment. You can also leave the environment by simply typing `deactivate`.

### Installation of Dependencies

To install the dependencies, simply run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Database Setup

django.nV provides you with a script automatically creates the database as well as populates it with data. This script is titled `reset_db.sh`. django.nV does not ship with the database, so in order to run the application properly, you'll need to use this script:

    ./reset_db.sh

You can also use the same script to reset the database if you make any changes.

### Running the application
To run the app in its application folder type:

    ./runapp.sh

You should then be able to access the web interface at `http://localhost:8000/`.

### Tutorials

django.nV comes with a series of writeups for the vulnerabilities we've added to the code. Each tutorial comes with a description of the vuln, a hint to where to find it, and then the exact bug and how it could be remedied.

You can access these tutorials within the app at `http://localhost:8000/taskManager/tutorials/`, or by clicking on the 'Tutorials' link in the top-right of the web interface.

### Mail ###

The only mail sent by the app is for the "Forgot Password" feature. You can use the built-in Python mailserver for those messages.

    python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:1025

If you prefer to use your own mailserver, simply add your settings to `settings.py`.
